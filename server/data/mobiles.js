        "description": "If money is no object, the S24 Ultra is the best smartphone you can buy right now. Samsung has put that high price tag to good use, delivering a superb user experience with no real weaknesses. And there are a catalogue of major strengths, from incredible overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 performance to five distinct camera lenses, each of which more than hold their own. You still get a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display and built-in S Pen, yet this is still a two-day phone for many people in terms of battery life. What’s more, the the software experience is the best it’s ever been, with a slick One UI skin over Android 14 and seven years of both OS and security updates. A selection of genuinely useful AI features are the icing on the cake. The S24 Ultra’s price and big, bulky design aren’t for everyone. But it’s the most complete smartphone money can buy."

        "description": "It’s the first smartphone that can genuinely replace a DSLR for most people, such is the quality and versatility of the system on offer. It includes four 50Mp rear lenses and a 32Mp selfie camera, all of which take superb photos in basically any environment. And while expensive, the optional Photography Kit accessory makes the experience even closer to a real camera. With a gorgeous design, stunning display, great performance and solid battery life supported by 90W fast charging, the 14 Ultra is one of the few phones that justifies its sky-high price tag. However, that also makes it unaffordable for many people, while the HyperOS software experience still isn’t great. Those two factors prevent it from being higher in this list, but if photography is your top priority, this is the phone to buy. If you’d rather something more affordable, the regular Xiaomi 14 is nearly as good when it comes to photography."

        "description": "If neither of the options above appeals you to, a Pixel 9 is probably your best bet. And if you want the absolute best experience, the newly-branded Pixel 9 Pro XL is the one to go for. While not quite the standout phone we saw with the Pixel 8 Pro, the 9 Pro XL still delivers a compelling experience in almost all key areas. The cameras are the highlight once again, offering vibrant, high-contrast photos while maintaining key details. That includes in low-light conditions, even if the brightening is by no means true to life. A quality ultrawide lens and 5x optical zoom from the telephoto make it an impressively versatile camera system, while selfies from the upgraded front lens are excellent. Elsewhere, the excellent 6.8-inch display is a joy to use, while Google’s Tensor G4 chipset delivers solid performance. And the build quality is higher than ever, even if the move to a more generic design will disappoint some people. Google continues to ace the software experience, even if the 9 Pro XL runs Android 14 out of the box and AI features are hit-and-miss. Google’s commitment to seven years of both OS and security updates is still yet to be beaten on any phone."

        "description": "Until we review the iPhone 16 Pro, its predecessor remains the iPhone for most people. The iPhone 15 Pro has a collection of small changes that, when combined, represent a significant upgrade. A new titanium build is durable but noticeable lighter, and there’s also a new customisable Action Button to replace the mute switch. Apple’s A17 Pro chipset is the most capable on any smartphone, and delivers truly stellar performance, while the introduction of USB-C is undoubtedly a step forward. The 6.1in display is relatively compact by modern phone standards, but it looks excellent and benefits from the 120Hz refresh rate. Battery life is generally solid, though you’ll still have to put up with slow charging speeds. But despite the missing 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, the all-round camera experience is superb. Many apps now support the genuinely useful Dynamic Island, and iOS 17 is just as slick and intuitive as ever."

        "description": "For a few years now, Google’s A-Series handsets have offered the best value for money in the entire smartphone. However, despite plenty of strengths, the Pixel 8a has been usurped in this regard by the OnePlus Nord 4. That starts with superb build quality, with one piece of sturdy aluminium extending across the back and sides of the phone. At the front is a gorgeous 120Hz OLED screen, supplemented by strong performance and all-day battery life. Provided you’re a fan of the design, the compromises here are concentrated around the cameras. There’s no telephoto lens, meaning zoom shots are disappointing, while the ultrawide OnePlus has opted for instead flatters to deceive. However, if you primarily use the main lens anyway, you won’t be disappointed. And with six years of security updates, the Nord 4’s longevity is almost as good as the Pixel 8a’s."
